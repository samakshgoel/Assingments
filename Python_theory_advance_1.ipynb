    "--Through inheritance we can achieve reusability. Also eliminate redundant code.\n",
    "--The principle of data hiding helps to build secure program.\n",

    "Answer 2\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python inheritance happens when an object is qualified and involves searching an attribute definition tree (one or more namespaces). Every time you use an expression of the form object's attribute where object is an instance or class object, Python searches the namespace tree at and above object, for the first attribute it can find."

    "CLASS OBJECT\n",
    "when we create a class in python then a class object is created so whenever python finds a class statement in the whole program then it creates a class object and assigns a name to that object i.e. class name. As we know in python, everything is an object so the class itself is an object and is the instance of metaclasses. \n",

    "Answer 4\n",
    "The first parameter in the class method is the class on which you are calling the method, not (necessarily) the class that defines the method. (Having a variable that always holds the same class would probably not be that useful.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first case, name mangling distinguishes the two fields, to protect you from accidentally shadowing private variables in a subclass. The field A.__x becomes A._A__x and B.__x becomes B._B__x. This ensures that you can't accidentally pick up a field in a subclass with a similar name to your private field in A. That's part of the reason name mangling exists.\n",
